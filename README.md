# Decision Tree Classifier - PCA and Model Evaluation

This project demonstrates the use of a **Decision Tree Classifier** for classification tasks. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to explore the impact of dimensionality reduction on model accuracy. The notebook also explores methods for evaluating model performance through cross-validation and metrics like accuracy.

## Project Overview
This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to building and evaluating a Decision Tree Classifier. Key concepts covered include:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Standardizing features to improve model performance.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction to improve computational efficiency and potentially enhance model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using cross-validation and accuracy metrics to assess model performance.

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project should be loaded into `x_train`, `x_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test` for the classifier to be trained and evaluated.
- If using a custom dataset, update the code to load it accordingly.

## Requirements
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib` (optional, for visualizations)

You can install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision-tree-classifier.git
   cd decision-tree-classifier
   ```
2. Install the dependencies as listed in the requirements section.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook task-3-decision-tree-classifier.ipynb
   ```
2. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction.
   - Train and evaluate the Decision Tree Classifier.

## Improvement Strategies
The notebook provides various techniques for improving model accuracy:
- **Cross-Validation**: Evaluate the model across multiple folds.
- **Alternative Models**: Consider ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting if accuracy needs further improvement.

## Results
The final section of the notebook includes a summary of the model's performance, accuracy scores for different PCA components, and potential improvements.
